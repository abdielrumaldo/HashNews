# HashNews

This is the frontend tests for my HashNews project. This application will serve as an archiver for news from popular sources. These articles will be stored in a picture format and displayed as a timeline for the user.

This repository will contain the front end of the application for the user to interact with. The backend responsible for retrieving images of news articles, storing the articles in a database and scraping the relevant data can be found here.

Once both parts are complete I will push the final product to this repository and keep the reusable components is PyScripts for future use.
